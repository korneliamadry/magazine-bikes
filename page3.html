            Let me say that everybody is riding a bike in Denmark. Cycling is a part of Danish culture. Photographs founded in danish art archives which You can see in this magazine (left side) show that cycling culture in Denmark has been around for a long time.
            Danes know what they are doing. Bicycles save near 240 million gallons of gas every year, save parking space and they are amazing for your health, concentrating and condition. Likewise, using public transport and cars here are really expensive...

            What's popular in Denmark is to use <i> Dolphin </i> bike which means trailers to carry up children behind a bike. Designed by Danish student Leif Hagerup in collaboration with the company A. Winther. Also Christiania Bikes is a Danish well-known manufacture from Copenhagen that has produced bicycle trailers mostly for carry children in front of the bike. <br><br>
            Unfortunately, thousands of bicycles are stolen in Denmark each year. It's against the law to buy a stolen bike, so in doubt check the registry in the local police station. And of course lock yours own and keep eye on it.

                <br>
                There are written and unwritten rules in cycling.<br>
                You must ride with both <u> lights ON </u> when dark or if the visibility is not optimal. Helmet is not required but advisable. Use a white front headlight and red taillight and front and back brakes as required by law.
                You have to drive on the <u>right-hand roads side </u>. Pass on left only when the lane is clear. If there is no bike path, you have to ride on the right side of the cars road. Also, if there is no traffic lights on your bike path, follow the car ones, not the pedestrian lights. Remember, <u> maintain a distance </u> from other bikes and cars.
                When a bus stops at a bus station the passengers have priority; you need to stop and wait. It's not allowed to driving no-hands without <u>holding the handlebars </u>. You are not allowed to carry another person on a single bike and You <u>can't talk on the phone</u>. You <u> can not </u> ride a bike if you are <u>drunk</u>. Good thing is that You can’t lose your driver’s license for cycling when drunk but the police will give You a high mandate.
