                <b> Pump bike tire</b> -
                remove the plastic cap that might be covering the end of your valve. Unscrew the tiny locking nut. You should be able to hear and feel a bit of air comes out. 
                Check the pounds-per-square-inch (psi) range of your tire. Usually it's 80-130 psi in road tires. Attach the pump correctly and pump the optimal pressure. Simply flip the switch on the pump head so it pops off, and retighten the locking nut before you replace the valve cap. And that is it!

                <b> Change of the inner tube </b> - this is probably the majority of typical defects that can happen during the bike ride. So...<br>
          
           -> release the brake and remove the tire  <br>
           -> unscrew the valve and let the air out  <br>
            -> remove the tire (on the opposite side from the valve) - you can use a spoon to help when it's not so easy  <br>
            -> check if the cause of the cracks is not on the wheel (sharp objects, spokes etc.) and remove them <br>
            -> take out the old one and put a new tube into the tire or cover the hole.  You can locate a hole by hearing or You can put a tube into the water and observe  <br>
            -> put your tire patiently and pump it  <br>
           -> pump to the value specified by the manufacturer (you will find it on the wheel) <br><br>
            
            The best way to learn fixing bike is to work with someone and observe. If You don't know anyone (for now) who get some skills in this, You may watch some tutorials film online for example:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLqrhFzW8s0"><u>here </u> </a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWchudX-Tqs"> <u>here</u></a>. 
            <br><br>
                Useful tip is to <u> take a picture </u> before you start DIY-repair with your bike; this will make it easier to assemble parts after. 
            <br><br>
            Don't forget to oil the chain in the winter time at least once a week.<br><br>
            While cycling the chain needs to be generally in the straight line for the best results. If you are in your hardest front gear, you shouldn't be in your easiest back gear. Do not change the gears when pedaling fast. <br><br><br>
